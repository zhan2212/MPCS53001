# HW2 ER Diagram

Create an ER-Diagram to model a simple application to capture a music collection application.

For full credit, your homework must be in a file in the hw2 directory, it should be titled hw2, and it must be either a pdf, jpg, or png format (e.g. hw2.pdf, hw2.jpg, or hw2.png). You can use any program to make the diagram or take a picture of a hand-drawn answer. You also must use the book notation / what we discussed in class.

Here we are trying to capture the following properties. Do not worry about adding anything beyond what is mentioned (unless it is necessary for correctness):

- An artist has a name and number of members.
- A song must be composed by a single artist. A song has a name and duration.
- Albums have a name and a release year.
- A song may appear on multiple albums and on each album it can have a single and unique track number (e.g. a song cannot appear on an album more than once and no two songs can share the same track/order number). A song's track number may differ for other albums.
- A user has a name and email address.
- Each user can review an album. A review has a comment and a score.
- Users can be friends with other users.
